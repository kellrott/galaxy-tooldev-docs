Learning Galaxy
===============

Before you can develop tools for Galaxy, it would be useful to know how people interface with it. There are a number of resources, including screen casts, tutorials and discussion forums that will help you learn how to use Galaxy. Before turning on your down Development VM, you can create an account on the [Public Galaxy Server](https://usegalaxy.org/). If you have any questions about how to use Galaxy or how to develop tools for it, there is a [Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) page where you can post questions and look for answers. To look for resources to help you on your way, look at the [Support Page](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Support)
